Converts multiple PNG files into a single multi-resolution ICO file

-Can merge several PNGs with different resolutions into one ICO file.

-Can export all icons inside an ICO file into PNGs

Exporting using the option "Unpack ICO-formatted icon file" loads and saves the bitmap to a new file. This is the recommended option, and works for any icon.

Exporting with "Unpack PNG-formatted icon file" only works for icons assembled with PNG images, and dumps the raw bytes used when creating the original file. This will not work for traditional ICO files.
